Uses and depends on Sfizz - https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz

The demo videos use the wonderful and free Virtual Playing Orchestra libraries - http://virtualplaying.com/virtual-playing-orchestra/

Current status: metasound node is enabled and can receive the harmonix midistream data type and render it, CPU performance is rather atrocious but you can use any SFZ instrument file and can even use a scala tuning file.
